description: Hate when you’re the first person to arrive to FoCo and proceed to wait in the lobby for the next 20 minutes? Ever sit awkwardly in Collis trying not to let anyone see you’re sitting alone while you’re friends take their time getting there? Well now with OnTime, you and your friends can always arrive simultaneously! This application will inform individuals organizing an event when they need to leave their current location in order to arrive at the destination at the specified event time. It will calculate departure times based on both a user’s current location as well as the current location status of other attendees. The app will be useful in helping all attendees synchronize their arrival times at the event so that no one will wait alone for the other attendees to get there.
