This paper describes the usage of an Artificial Neural Network to determine the success or failure of a potential restaurant. We analyze the [Yelp Academic Dataset](yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset) which includes all the data and reviews of the 250 closest businesses for 30 universities. Our approach is to utilize stochastic gradient descent and back propagation to built a model for determining success or failure of a restaurant given a set of business characteristics. We compare performance among a variety of neural network architectures and utilize dummy variables to increase the size of our usable dataset. Finally, we discuss performance of our best performing neural networks compared to our baseline models of logistic regression and support vector machines.
