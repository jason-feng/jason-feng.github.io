Dynamic fitness tracker that tracks your activity type automatically and maps out your activity routes. You have the option to manually or automatically add exercise entries. The automatic entries utilize machine learning classifers to detect activity type. Location tracking in the background is used to plot the route of your activity. All of your data is stored locally in a SQLlite database and automatically uploaded and synchorized with a google cloud server.

Technologies Used:

* Android (obviously)
* Weka for machine learning the accelerometer data
* Google Cloud for our cloud database
* SQLLite local database
