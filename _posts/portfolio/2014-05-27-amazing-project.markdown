The goal of this project is for each team to design, implement, and test a client application that simulates you and your friends searching for each other in a maze that is generated and managed by a separate server application. Each person in the maze will be represented by an Avatar. The maze is rectangular, and is a "perfect" maze. A perfect maze is defined as a maze which has one and only one path from any point in the maze to any other point. This means that the maze has no inaccessible sections, no circular paths, and no open areas.
