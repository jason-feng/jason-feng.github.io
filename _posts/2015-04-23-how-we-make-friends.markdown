This post is really a continuation of the thoughts I had from my previous post.

One of my closest friends once told me that he only considers himself friends with someone after a year starting from the beginning of their relationship. Half of it is probably just a joke to piss people off because that’s what his personality is like, but the other half I think he honestly takes to heart.

In his mind, friendship is something that both members have to commit to and it can’t be just a half-assed commitment. Friendships takes hours upon hours of time to work out. Especially during this time when we are in college, constantly traveling and moving from place to place, it’s almost like we have a long distance relationship with a lot of our friends.

This same friend also has another concept called “ratio”. Ratio is simply the amount you text compared to the other person in the conversation. For instance if my friend and I pretty much have an ongoing conversation in which we both type similar amounts and are similarly engaged in the conversation, then we would have a “good” ratio. On the other hand, if I needed to consistently initiate the conversation, receive really brief and short responses to my meaningful and thought out messages, then we would have a “bad” ratio.

Although this may sound like a superficial method of defining a friendship, if one sits down and thinks about it, it’s a pretty accurate measurement. If two individuals truly have an outstanding relationship, why wouldn’t they want to talk to each other, why wouldn’t they give each other equal attention, why wouldn’t they be willing to initial conversations on their own?

Having such commitment established over a year is a true sign of one’s willingness to be friends with someone else. This shouldn’t be hard if you enjoy that person’s thoughts and presence, it should come completely naturally. The year marker is simply an arbitrary date, a symbol of one’s willingness to be a good friend.

I still joke with this friend that my one year anniversary is almost coming up and that we still “are not” friends yet. Although I am certain we will be great friends for years to come.
