Wow so this is one of first blog posts in a really long time. There used to be a period of time a la high school when I used to right these. Or more accurately, when I tried to get myself to get into writing personal posts. This is probably attempt #5 to start again, we'll see how this one goes.

During my most recent spring break, myself, along with two friends took a trip down to LA. Before we even started there was some already unnecessary drama created. Because of a mistake on my behalf... we ended up leaving for the airport approximately 40 minutes before our flight. Even my dad had no faith that we would make our flight. But to our surprise, the airport was pretty much completely empty and the security had no lines at all. Although I had to give up my giant bottle of sunscreen at security (who thought sunscreen was a liquid, it's SQUEEZEABLE), the trip was off to an exhilarating start as we sprinted down the airport looking for our boarding gate. We made it just on time, there was even another lady that boarded 10 minutes after us - clearly this was not my fault at all.


We started off in sunny northern California and traveled to what seemingly was even sunnier southern California. As we got off in possibily one of the jankiest airports I've personally been to, I could already feel the heat coming. To our surprise we were accompanied by a warm friendly stranger: in order to get around the extremely strict regulations surrounding taxi companies and airports, our wonderful grandpa of an Uber driver decided to greet me with a great big hug. To the dismay of the angry looking traffic officers surrounding the airport, this seemed to be legitimate enough for them to leave us alone.

Arriving in LA, priority numero uno was simply planning all of the delicious foods were we going to eat. As someone who literally goes to school in the middle of nowhere, this was one of my few chances throughout the year to eat some real food. I was pumped.

Enough about the food. Now let's talk a little bit just about my personal reflection during my trip. It was pretty much determined by my friends and I that I have difficulties being in touch with my emotions. I donâ€™t really know how I feel about this entire thing. Maybe there are some deep emotions within myself that I have hidden, who knows. The rest of this will be continued another time.
