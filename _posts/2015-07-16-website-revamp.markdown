After just being extremely tired with maintaining my existing website, I decided to find a new home for my personal blog. Welcome to my new website! It is heavily based off of the [Ghost Casper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper).

Inspired by blogs such as [Zach Holman](zachholman.com), [Chris Dixon](http://cdixon.org/), and [Ryan Hoover](http://ryanhoover.me/), I wanted to pursue my own website that was more focused on producing content rather than showcasing my past experiences.

Here's to starting off my new blog! ![Excitement gif](http://i.giphy.com/mzTKsByk8Xl6g.gif)
