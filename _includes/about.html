Ever since I was a child, I have been surrounded by technology, from nearby tech giants Google and Apple, to my own parents who worked in the technology sector. Technology has been part of my life from the very beginning and my passion for it continues to grow.</p>

Although Dartmouth was an enormous change from the suburban life I have grown used to, the college has grown on me and allowed me to appreciate where I came from even more. At Dartmouth I am a computer science major and mathematics minor.</p>
