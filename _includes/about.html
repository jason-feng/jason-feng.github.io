                                    <p class="text-muted">Born in Shanghai, raised in the bay area, Los Angeles Lakers fan. Interesting how that worked out. Ever since I was a child, I have been surrounded by technology, from nearby tech giants Google and Apple, to my own parents who worked in the technology sector. Technology has been part of my life from the very beginning and my passion for it continues to grow. The bay area is the best, not only for the great variety of cuisine, but the collection of scenic routes and hikes just miles away.</p>

Although Dartmouth was an enormous change from the suburban life I have grown used to, the college has grown on me and allowed me to appreciate where I came from even more. At Dartmouth I am a computer science major and mathematics minor.</p>
