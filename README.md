Jason Feng Personal Website
====================
This is the source for my personal website, which showcases some projects I have worked on along with fun facts about myself.

The website is built using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), a ruby based static site generator.

The theme of the website utilizes the Jekyll version of the Agency bootstrap theme which can be found [here](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme).

The instagram feed is built using [instafeed](instafeedjs.com) and [simplyscroll](http://logicbox.net/jquery/simplyscroll/).
